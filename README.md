### National Vision, Strategy, Masterplan <a name="national-vision-strategy-masterplan"></a> 

Transport:
- Jordan's Long-Term Transport Strategy sets short-term goals for 2024 and long-term targets for 2030. It outlines policies, infrastructure development, and service improvements across road, rail, aviation, maritime, public transport, and freight. The plan includes phased implementation and budget estimates. A key focus is promoting energy-efficient transport, such as hybrid and electric vehicles, with CO2 emission reduction as a key environmental metric. https://www.mot.gov.jo/EBV4.0/Root_Storage/EN/EB_Info_Page/long-term_national_transport_strategy_project.pdf

General:
- Jordan's National Vision and Strategy for 2025 outlines the country's socio-economic development goals, emphasizing sustainability and green growth across key sectors like agriculture, energy, tourism, transport, waste, and water. Climate change mitigation is a core focus, shaping targets for afforestation, energy efficiency, resource management, and environmental protection. https://climate-laws.org/documents/jordan-2025-a-national-vision-and-strategy_a5f6?id=jordan-2025-a-national-vision-and-strategy_46fc
- Jordan's National Strategy and Action Plan for Sustainable Consumption and Production (2016-2025) targets three key sectors: agriculture, transport, and waste management. It aligns with Jordan Vision 2025 to promote sustainable agriculture, expand public transport, and improve waste management. The plan includes operational objectives like fostering green finance, technological innovation, and low-carbon transport alternatives, supported by a detailed action plan, budgets, timelines, and stakeholders for implementation. https://climate-laws.org/documents/national-strategy-and-action-plan-for-sustainable-consumption-and-production-2016-2025_5e74?q=transport&l=jordan&id=national-strategy-and-action-plan-for-sustainable-consumption-and-production-2016-2025_3604

### Transport Plans, Concepts etc at State level <a name="state-level"></a>

- 

### Urban mobility plans, strategies, and concepts; local transport plans, etc <a name="local-transport-plans"></a>  

- Amman‚Äôs Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is a key infrastructure project designed to transform urban mobility with high-capacity buses on dedicated lanes, serving over 315,000 passengers daily. https://araburban.org/en/infohub/projects/?id=7674

### Studies and research papers <a name="studies-research"></a> 

- The Public Transportation in Jordan Policy Study (2017) analyzes challenges in Jordan‚Äôs transit system and proposes policy solutions. It highlights issues like inadequate infrastructure, poor service quality, and limited accessibility. The report recommends regulatory reforms, investment in public transport infrastructure, and improved governance to create a more efficient, sustainable, and inclusive transport system. https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5671433fc647ad9f55531f40/t/58c7cc2a6b8f5ba6ce63ec68/1489488942230/Public+Transportation+in+Jordan+-+A+Policy+Study+Report.pdf

- The UN-Habitat Thematic Guide (2021) emphasizes integrating transport and mobility into Jordan‚Äôs National Urban Policy (JNUP) to create more inclusive, compact, and sustainable cities. It highlights transport as a key economic driver but identifies challenges such as rapid population growth, refugee influx, and car dependency, which strain urban mobility. While Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) projects are a step forward, the guide stresses the need for comprehensive transport planning to ensure a resilient, efficient, and sustainable urban transport system in Jordan. https://unhabitat.org/mainstreaming-transport-and-mobility-into-jordans-national-urban-policy-thematic-guide
- A review of public transport in Jordan: challenges and opportunities - Jordan's public transport is underdeveloped, with low vehicle availability, cheap fares, and limited coverage, leading to low user satisfaction. The review calls for increased investment, private sector involvement, and legislative reforms to improve the system. https://ajrs.ammanu.edu.jo/ojs/index.php/albalqajournal/article/view/198

### International cooperation projects and strategies <a name="international-cooperation"></a>

- The BRCCJ project will increase new supplies of water by recycling wastewater and harvesting rainwater. By reducing the demand on groundwater sources through efficient cropping and water use practices, the project will bolster vulnerable farmers' climate resilience - particularly women who play a critical role in Jordan‚Äôs agricultural sector. https://www.greenclimate.fund/project/fp155
- Jordan receives climate finance from the GCF, GEF, and Adaptation Fund for mitigation and adaptation projects. The GCF supports Jordan with two concept notes, one project preparation facility, and three full funding proposals, along with readiness support to attract further funding. The GEF has provided over $70 million for environmental projects, while the Adaptation Fund has allocated over $10 million for vulnerable communities, with more projects underway. http://jordanclimatechange.com/en-us/projects/
